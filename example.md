main_findings:
- Solar wind discontinuities evolve in space with occurrence rate
  decreasing, **thickness increasing** and **current density
  decreasing** with distance from the Sun. And they are probably
  **generated locally** beyond 1 AU.
- Background sheared magnetic field plays an important role in
  determining the efficiency of ion pitch angle
- "scattering, and characterize three ion populations: **transient,
  trapped, regular**."
